Although it is trivial to make a naive brainfuck interpreter, writing an optimizing compiler or interpreter becomes more of a challenge and amusement much like writing programs in brainfuck itself is: to produce reasonably fast results, the compiler needs to piece together the fragmentary instructions forced by the language. Possible optimizations range from simple run-length peephole optimizations on repeated commands and common loop patterns like <code>[-]</code>, to more complicated ones like dead code elimination and constant folding.

In addition to optimization, other types of unusual brainfuck interpreters have also been written. Several brainfuck compilers have been made smaller than 200 bytes â€“ one is only 100 bytes in x86 machine code.
